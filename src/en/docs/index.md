RESTCaptcha is an easy-to-integrate, privacy-friendly CAPTCHA solution that does not require users to solve image puzzles or maths problems.

Instead, RESTCaptcha uses a proof-of-work mechanism to verify human interaction with your form.

## Features

* Stateless challenge with an HMAC-signed nonce (a one-time-use string)
* Client-side proof-of-work puzzle (SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 hash below a defined threshold)
* CDN-ready `restcaptcha.min.js` script with a configurable API endpoint
* Easy to integrate with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet), or any other server technology
* Fully customisable
* Supports four different modes (interactive, automatic, invisible, headless)
* Multilingual (currently: English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish)
+ Build with [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript).

## How it works

If the term *CAPTCHA* doesn’t mean much to you, have a look at the chapter [What are CAPTCHAs?](captcha.md) first.

In simple terms, RESTCaptcha works as follows:

1. You integrate the RESTCaptcha widget into your website — typically into a registration or contact form.
2. The user visiting your website receives a token from the RESTCaptcha server (this happens transparently in the background). Their web browser must then solve a small computational task by clicking a checkbox (optionally, this can also happen without any click).
3. Once the user has filled in the form, it is submitted to your server (the one hosting your website). The token and the puzzle solution are sent along with the form data.
4. Before processing the submitted data, your server must verify the token and the puzzle solution by making an API request to the RESTCaptcha server. If verification succeeds, everything is fine; otherwise, your server should assume the request came from a bot.

## Live demos

    We have implemented a small website using PHP and Bootstrap 5 to demonstrate the use of RESTCaptcha.

    We have built the same website using ASP.NET Core and Bootstrap 5.
