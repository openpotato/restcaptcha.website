# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Is RESTCaptcha really free? Aren’t there already other CAPTCHA solutions? In our FAQ you’ll find answers to the most commonly asked questions about the RESTCaptcha project.

## Can I use RESTCaptcha free of charge?

Yes. RESTCaptcha is open source, free to use, and permitted for commercial projects as well. RESTCaptcha is licensed under the [AGPL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openpotato/restcaptcha/refs/heads/main/LICENSE).

## Aren’t there already a thousand other CAPTCHA solutions?

Not literally thousands, but yes — there are quite a few. However, they differ significantly in important ways:

* Well-known options such as Google reCAPTCHA are free to use but not (fully) open source. You’ll need to balance functionality and data protection, and accept a degree of vendor dependency.

* Some open-source solutions are only partly open source, i.e. a “core” edition intended to whet the appetite for a fuller SaaS offering. That doesn’t necessarily mean the core edition is a bad choice.

* Others are fully open source, but still rooted in the old world of image puzzles and distorted text.

If you’re looking for a modern CAPTCHA you can run yourself, that’s completely open source, requires no dependencies such as a database, and you happen to have a soft spot for the [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core) open-source platform, RESTCaptcha is well worth a look.

## What exactly does “running it yourself” mean?

Running a solution like RESTCaptcha yourself (self-hosting) means that, as the administrator, you install, configure, and operate RESTCaptcha on a server of your choice. You retain full control over your CAPTCHA service. All information on installing, configuring, and integrating RESTCaptcha can be found on this website.
