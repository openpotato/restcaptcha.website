The RESTCaptcha API for verifying tokens and challenge solutions can be accessed directly via HTTP/HTTPS requests. However, where available, using a client library is the more elegant option.

The following libraries are available:

## .NET

* [openpotato/restcaptcha-client.net](https://github.com/openpotato/restcaptcha-client.net): Official RESTCaptcha API [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) client library.

## PHP

* [openpotato/restcaptcha-client.php](https://github.com/openpotato/restcaptcha-client.php): Official RESTCaptcha API [PHP](https://www.php.net/) client library.
